File: favoriteEditor.txt
Content: Contains my favorite editor and my 2 reasons for it (Q.#1)

File: shellScript.sh
Content: I created a for loop to loop through all the .txt files in a directory. I created two variables words, to hold the number of words in a file and lines, to hold the number of lines in a file. I used if-elif-else statments to decide the action to be taken given the number of words/lines. If there are 0 words (could also use 0 lines but used words for variation) I removed the file. I changed the files name to reflect the number of lines in a file. (Q. #2)

Files: screenshots.docx, screenshots.pdf
Content: Contains two screenshots to show the effect of running my program. The first screenshot is the 'before' image. It contains the names of the files in the current directoty along with the number of words and lines in each file. The second screenshot is the 'after' image. It contains text that was printed (echoed) during the programs execution. It also contains the files with their new names and in the case for d.txt, it's name was not shown since it was deleted.
